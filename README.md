## About the Project
This is a project I created to complete **[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard)** Design to Code assignment.

This is my own solution. I wrote every line of codes on my own and it got almost pixel perfect to the design file.
